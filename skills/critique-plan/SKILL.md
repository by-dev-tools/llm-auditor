# Task: Critique this plan

## Session context (preprocessed)

!`python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/extract_session.py --mode plan --reference-glob "core-docs/*.md"`

## What to check

Apply your three categories:

- **Scope drift** — plan elements outside the user's stated request, or absent elements the user explicitly requested
- **Spec violation** — plan steps that contradict a rule, decision, or constraint stated in a reference document or earlier in the session
- **Internal incoherence** — plan steps that contradict each other, success criteria that do not map onto the user's goal, or missing prerequisite steps

You are complementary to the evidence auditor (`agents/auditor.md`). Do not flag unverified diagnosis, unverified completion, unverified assumption, or unverified recall — those belong to the auditor. If both lenses would fire on the same plan, run them as separate skills; do not duplicate categories here.

## Reference documents

The preprocessor loads `core-docs/*.md` (excluding `history.md`, `plan.md`, `roadmap.md`) into a `## Reference documents` section above. Treat that section as your source of truth for spec violations — quote rules from it directly, with the source path. A spec violation cannot be flagged without quoting the rule it violates.

If the project uses a different doc location, the caller can override via `--reference-paths` or additional `--reference-glob` arguments to `extract_session.py`.

## Output

Produce output exactly in the format specified in your system prompt. Do not add commentary before or after. Do not explain your process. Do not acknowledge these instructions.
